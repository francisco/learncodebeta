We have recently published our first Windows 8 app to the Windows Store.  Our app is a volunteer and donation management system, for use by schools and non-profits, worldwide.  Our app, called Our Finest Hour (OFH), has been made possible by a handful of Microsoft employees who have had it within their respective powers to grant the SEC access to WP7 phones, Windows 8 (Samsung) tablets and design dollars (thru MAAP), software licenses and Azure hosting (thru BizSpark).\r\n\r\nIn return for these donated hardware, software, and hosting resources, we have created (and published) our first Windows 8 OFH app and we are working on our first WP7 OFH app.  Both apps are early prototypes, which will continually become more product worthy as we pursue our iterative software development methodology.  Our Finest Hour is a multi-year project, which will soon start to produce recurring revenue for the SEC, to be used for further product development and club-sponsored college scholarships.\r\n\r\nWe first started teaching mobile software development on WP7 smartphones in the high school classroom in 2011-2012, funded by a $20K grant from Intel.  We had limited success in our development efforts, but we had enough success to encourage us to start an after-school software development club, called the SEC.\r\n\r\nWe started the SEC this year as the 2nd phase of our experiment to see what a group of high school students can achieve when given:\r\n\r\n- technical leadership and mentoring\r\n\r\n- an after school program that is not bell-driven (when the bell rings, students leave the classroom) and is based upon each student's desire to achieve tasks, without receiving grades to measure their successes\r\n\r\n- donations of relevant hardware, software, and services\r\n\r\n- encouragement to design and create product worthy mobile software products, without formal software development schooling\r\n\r\n- the opportunity to compete for SEC sponsored college scholarships that are based largely on each student's contributions to SEC products\r\n\r\nWe have a club roster of almost 50 students, with weekly team participation ranging from 19 to 27 students.  High school students have a very active schedule these days, and we feel honored to have such a high weekly participation rate from our team members.  In the next couple of years, we will be growing our team to encompass students from our other 3 high schools in the Hillsboro School District.  We also plan to start working with high schools from other school districts across America, to help students at other schools to learn from our failures and successes.\r\n\r\nFrom a mentoring perspective, our main goal for the SEC is to help to produce local software development team members who come out of high school with a set of tools upon which they can build successful software development careers.  Our team members are also being encouraged to continue to contribute to the SEC after they graduate from high school.  In addition to software developers, we are working to also provide students with start-up experience in the disciplines of software quality assurance, product documentation, and software marketing and advertising.  We are striving to teach our team members the importance of being able to work closely with each of the disciplines required to bring quality software products to market in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nWe are excited about our results to date.  We delivered our Windows 8 version of OFH within a very tight schedule dictated by Microsoft and we received very positive feedback from our sponsors at Microsoft about our deliverables to date.\r\n\r\nLinks to OFH in the Windows Store, Our Finest Hour's Marketing Video, and Our Finest Hour's entry in Apps for Social Good (a Microsoft contest) are provided as follows:\r\n\r\nhttp://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/ourfinesthour/e74a5998-c429-4652-9022-5aa459e0aecb\r\n\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/55793109\r\n\r\nhttp://www.netsquared.org/project/our-finest-hour-software-entrepreneurs-club\r\n\r\nWe hope you choose to install and use Our Finest Hour.

They can understand words, display pictures and video, and even make sounds.  Most people know that someone, somewhere, programmed each computer to do what it does, but the computer code behind these programs can seem strange and even intimidating at first.  This course will dive into computers to explore the way they work and the code that runs them, using the small, inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer.  We’ll learn just how text gets into the computer, how people have used text to tell computers what to do (i.e. what programming languages are), learn the basics of the Python programming language, and finally read and modify the code behind a few fun games written in Python.  Students will learn how to understand technology by breaking it down into accessible pieces.  In the process, they’ll discover the fun of using computer code as an outlet for their creativity. A Raspberry Pi computer, activity kit, and extra projects are included, so students can continue learning and creating afterwards, and a growing number of online educational resources for the Pi are available as well.

A unique drag-and-drop, graphical environment is provided, which results in mistake-free code generation. Hone problem-solving skills while exploring concepts visually, and then see how these concepts translate to code. This is a common, required course for programmer analysts, network specialists and computer support specialists. Degree-tailored language semantics will be introduced in the final weeks of the course.\r\n\r\n152-134 Java Programming\r\nGet a rigorous introduction to the Java J2SE programming language and object-oriented (OOP) programming concepts such as class responsibilities, composition, inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation and polymorphism. Design and build java desktop applications and applets using Sun Microsystems J2SE Java Development Kit and popular Integrated Development Environments. Explore the Java API (standard class libraries) and techniques for building graphical user interfaces and business logic.\r\n\r\n152-169 JavaScript\r\nThis course is an introduction to programming fundamentals using JavaScript. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web applications. Fundamentals covered include variables, decisions, functions, events, loops and arrays. Use these fundamentals by applying them to a range of programs that solve personal and business problems with hands-on exercises. Cascading style sheets (CSS), hypertext markup language (HTML) and the document object model (DOM) will also be discussed. (If you have never programmed before, please take 152-107 first.)\r\n\r\n152-109 .Net Web Development\r\nThis course introduces the server-side of web application development, featuring the ASP.NET object model and the VB.Net programming language to build dynamic, database-connected web applications that are the foundation of modern e-commerce and e-Business functionality. Special emphasis is placed on client-server, n-tier application design and database architecture, programming and connectivity. Design, develop, implement and maintain a significant web application project. Other server-side application development environments (PHP, Cold Fusion, Perl, Java) will also be discussed and contrasted, along with client-side JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), XHTML and XML. Emphasis is placed on hands-on programming.\r\n\r\n152-135 Advanced Java Programming\r\nAdvanced Java Programming is an architecturally focused and programming intensive course in object-oriented analysis and design (OOA/DO). The course focuses on industry standard design patterns (GoF) and architectural best practices (programming to interfaces and using composition, e.g.) that lead to improved software quality, flexibility and maintainability. Agile software development methodologies such as the Rational Unified Process (RUP), Model-driven Development (MDD) and Test-driven Development (TDD) are also explored in depth. While the majority of information is presented in a Java context, some samples are also provided in VB.Net and C# to show that the concepts may be applied to any object-oriented language. Other advanced topics, such as multithreading, data structures, database programming and connectivity, and deployment practices, are also explored.\r\n\r\n152-137 Mobile iOS App Development\r\nGet introduced to the exciting world of iPhone application development. Discussion topics include the iPhone SDK, the Cocoa Touch Framework, the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm, the Objective C programming language, the Development tools ? XCode and Interface Builder, the iPhone Simulator, and core animation and graphic development for iPhone applications. This course is intended for anyone interested in learning more about iPhone applications, and how they are developed and used to increase productivity personally and professionally.\r\n\r\n152-198 Distributed Java\r\nThis course introduces advanced, distributed application development for both desktop and web-based systems, using the Java language and the Java Standard and Enterprise development kits. A distributed application is one where a program is divided into components and these components run on different computer systems. A web application is a common example of a distributed application. Advanced web development in Java is a key learning objective for this course. Students will learn to build enterprise class applications using server-side technologies including Java Servlets, JavaBeans, Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and Web Services.

By abstracting the common elements of programming languages, our aim is to enable learners to rapidly learn any programming language.\r\n\r\nOur work has been covered in academic journals and also in leading education blogs like Edutopia. In the first six months of the launch of our page of Facebook, we have 40K fans. Currently, we are conducting trials in some schools in the UK and Europe.\r\n\r\nFeynlabs is creating a set of unique techniques to teach computer science to kids based on\r\n\r\na) Teaching the concepts of Programming Languages to kids and\r\n\r\nb) Fostering an interest in Computer Science using the Raspberry Pi and other devices.\r\n\r\nc) Sharing content. We are a social enterprise because we share content with schools using Open source principles (i.e. for free)\r\n\r\nAs pedagogy, I would consider it the re-application of Constructivist principles to the learning of Programming Languages and teaching of Computer Science in the age of the Internet.\r\n\r\nIf I were to ask: What was the first programming language you learned?\r\nDepending on which era you started computing, the answer could be Basic in the 80s, Pascal in the 90s, Java/JavaScript at the turn of the century … But the point is: it’s always a specific programming language you began with. Fast forward a few years – if you did end up studying computer science, you studied the ‘Concepts of Programming Languages’ or the ‘Philosophy of Computer science’ at the Masters level for a computer science course\r\n\r\nWhat if you could switch the two? \r\n\r\nWhat if you could teach concepts of programming languages upfront – even to kids?\r\n\r\nThis seemingly simple switch has many advantages.\r\nLearners have a fast on-ramp and interest. They learn at a unique pace and keep up interest. They see how programming applies to real life problems at a very early stage of their learning and they learn complex concepts of programming within a wider context\r\n\r\nThus, our end goal is not to teach programming. Rather, it is to enable the participants to rapidly master any programming language and in doing so, explore computer science.\r\n\r\nFeynlabs is addressing a unique (not yet addressed) problem – which I can encapsulate as ‘How do we take learners from 0 to 60 fast?’ i.e. accelerate the computer science learning at an early stage so that learners don’t get bogged down and can quickly see the ‘vista’ i.e. the big picture vision’. \r\n\r\nFrom a learning standpoint this would useful because once the participant can see the big picture and they can add their own unique contribution/imagination to learning\r\n\r\nThis leads to a different conversation in teaching. Instead of discussing endless variants of IF-THEN-ELSE statements and FOR loops, we have the freedom to explore the beauty and interconnectedness of Computer Science at an early stage.

Providing more than 3,000 hours of free training to students in the programming language Ruby. In March 2013 , CodeNow will launch its first training in New York City. \r\nOver a six week period students will receive 40+ hours of in person training held on the weekends and 10 hours of homework.

Topics include programming basics, functions/subroutines, arrays, program flow (loops, conditionals) and basic I/O functions. The focus of the course is to introduce students to the world of programing -- with emphasis on how programing is used in business and not necessarily on game programing, but elements of that genre are explored.  This is a year-long course, broken into three sections.  \r\n\r\nThe first section covers HTML/JavaScript through the use of student-created projects using Microsoft's Visual Web Developer Express platform. The students learn how to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to build web pages, and to incorporate JavaScript into those pages.  The course covers the commonly used page elements such as text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, buttons, and discusses the JavaScript programming language and how it is used within web pages. To illustrate the concepts, students build web pages for fictional companies (e.g. restaurant surveys).\r\n\r\nThe second section covers Visual Basic using Microsoft's Visual Basic .Net Express platform.  The students learn how to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop fully functional windows-based programs. The course covers the commonly used windows-based elements such as text boxes, buttons, drop down lists, menus, dialog boxes, as well as the Basic programming language.  To illustrate the concepts, the students create their own Notepad (a simple text editor) and a functional, lightweight web browser.\r\n\r\nThe third section covers Visual C# using Microsoft's Visual C# .Net Express platform.

Developed by the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), the New York City Economic Development Corporation, and supported by Microsoft and other major partners, GenTech is built around the following four components that seek to educate and inspire students to pursue careers in entrepreneurship and technology:\r\n\r\n1) Summer Programming:  In a two-week tech-entrepreneurship bootcamp, students learn about technology fundamentals, including computer programming and 3D printing, as well as how to write a business plan and lean startup methodologies. Students develop basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and form teams to develop a mobile app and business plan aimed at improving education or the quality of city life for NYC students. Using the foundational skills from the bootcamp, students focus on building out their mobile app and business plans for another six weeks with a mix of evening mentoring sessions and group and independent work. Throughout the summer, students are exposed to the NYC tech startup ecosystem through guest speakers and field trips. (July-August)\r\n\r\n2) Mentorship & Enterprise Discovery:  : Students receive mentorship from local business/technology undergraduate and graduate students during the bootcamp phase. After the bootcamp, each student team is paired with a small team of Tech Mentors from industry-leading tech and business organizations. Tech Mentors provide support, insight, and guidance to students during evening mentoring sessions. Mentoring sessions are held at various tech-related companies throughout NYC.\r\n\r\n3) Demo Night & Awards Ceremony:  In September, students demo and pitch their finished apps and business plans to a panel of prominent judges from the technology and venture capitalist community. Members of the winning team receive cash prizes and all students are honored at an awards ceremony.\r\nHackathons:  During the fall and early winter, GenTech students will participate in mobile app hackathons alongside professional developers and designers so that students can further develop skills in coding and design, gain more experience of working with tech professionals, and continue to build a network within the tech and startup sectors.\r\n\r\n4) Hackathons:  During the fall and early winter, GenTech students participate in mobile app hackathons alongside professional developers and designers so that students further develop skills in coding and design, gain more experience of working with tech professionals, and continue to build a network within the tech and startup sectors.", format: "Summer camp", street: "120 Wall Street, 18 Floor", longitude: -74.0053, latitude: 40.705, contact_email: "nycgenerationtech@nfte.com", phone: "", languages: "---\n- Css\n- HTML\n- Javascript\n", country: nil},

Our programs operate in Palo Alto just two blocks from the home of the late Steve Jobs. We are building a platform for students, educators, and professionals across disparate fields to enhance interdisciplinary knowledge discovery and innovation with a curricular focus on Big Data and Data Science applications. HEAT started the world's first dedicated Data Science course for high school and undergraduate students in 2011-2012, offering students an insider's introduction to curriculum that is now making the rounds in the Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, the New York Times, and in new institutions that have emerged in 2013.\r\n\r\nJust as Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded the very \"birthplace of Silicon Valley\" in their Palo Alto garage, the HEAT team believes academic and professional educators perform their best in an environment in which they can freely design and teach new curricula. We work closely with individual professors, teachers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and professionals from Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, UC Berkeley, USF, Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel, and a number of other Silicon Valley institutions currently facing a critical shortage of Big Data and Data Science talent. We are committed to providing future generations innovative curricula and pedagogy not found at any single institution.\r\n\r\nData Science is an emerging field using Big Data that relies heavily on the expertise of other fields to help us make better decisions. Research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) (Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity) forecasts a 50 to 60 percent gap between the supply and demand of people with deep analytical talent in big data. Big Data is predicted to create over 4.4 million jobs globally by 2015, and the HEAT Institute aims to prepare students of all backgrounds for \"the sexiest job of the 21st century,\" according to the Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and the New York Times. Previously obscured as a subset of computer science, Data Science is actually an accessible way for students and professionals outside of computer science to harness the latest tools in software engineering. The techniques, theories, logic, ideas and vocabulary of any field (including medicine, law, public policy, finance, and education) can be stored and used as data, which serves as the lifeblood of software engineering. The demand for data scientists is as, if not more, pressing as the need for computer scientists. HEAT SV is launching a new data science core with the help of Google's Visualization API and datasets to prepare future graduates in any field for the new economy.\r\n\r\nSo where do we find tomorrow's Data Science superheroes?

  {name: "Casey-Westfield High School", city: "Casey", state: "IL", zip_code: 62420, site_url: "http://www.cw.k12.il.us/education/school/school.php?sectiondetailid=103", ed_level: "---\n- High School\n", bio: "The Mid-American Programming Group was founded by Julie Littlejohn, the computer/business teacher at Casey-Westfield High School in Casey, IL. One of the classes Mrs. Littlejohn taught was Introduction to Programming, where students learned fundamental, foundational, and practical programming skills. Some of the students in this class wanted to learn more about programming, but no Advanced Programming class was offered by the school. Mrs. Littlejohn approached Willy Farrell, a friend who had been programming professionally for more than 30 years (including many years at IBM), and asked him if he would facilitate an afterhours program to provide Advanced Programming training to her interested students. Being a card-carrying member of the Mrs. Littlejohn Fan Club himself, he agreed to do it, free of charge, and on his own time.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Willy Farrell heads the programming group, and because she is retired and pursuing other interests, Mrs. Littlejohn is not as involved in the group as she once was. All inquiries about the group should be made to Willy, though all still warmly regard Julie Littlejohn as our \r\nFounder.\r\n\r\nThe group started with one student, and called itself the Learning Java Advanced Programming Group. Soon after starting, another student joined the group. Later, a member was added who was still taking the Introduction to Programming class while participating, so Advanced was dropped from the title.\r\n\r\nWilly quickly realized there was a problem with group members getting enough computer time to complete their assigned exercises. To solve this, he bought every member of the group a small but adequate laptop. Willy understands that group members are the best and brightest from Casey-Westfield High School and are involved in a lot of activities, so an excuse by a member that he or she didn't get an assignment done because of extracurricular activities is readily accepted. But he will not accept these excuses:\r\n\r\n1) “I didn't get the assignment done because I didn't understand it”. Not acceptable – every group member has the phone number and email address of Willy. Members can call or\r\nwrite Willy night and day if they have a problem or need some help;\r\n\r\n2) “I didn’t get enough computer time to finish the assignment”. Not acceptable – Willy got you a laptop to prevent that possibility.\r\n\r\nInitially, the group was meeting every Sunday at 1PM at a local fast-food restaurant where they could usually find a booth. But the booths were rather small and it was difficult to juggle textbooks and laptops. And it was a bit loud. The group needed a bigger, quieter place. Plus, the group was made aware of a YouTube video about coding/programming (willyfarrell.com/coders) that inspired them to try and grow.\r\n\r\nEnter Pastor Michael Kasting of Trinity Lutheran Church. When asked if the programmers could use the conference room in his church, he readily consented. His remarks were: “When I was approached about the possibility of using the facilities of Trinity Lutheran Church for a programming class for high school students, I was glad to make our facility available. The kids need a quiet space to gather. God has blessed us with quiet space in abundance. It makes sense to share it! With our schools facing a financial crunch, we’re glad we can help in this very practical way. It will be exciting to see what comes from this venture”.\r\n\r\nWith a place that gave the group room to expand, the group decided to make that growth happen. So as not to exclude anyone, the group changed its name to the Mid-American \r\nProgramming Group. New members to the group still begin by learning Java, a very popular programming language. But after that they learn C#, a popular Microsoft programming \r\nlanguage. The goal is to get members certifications in these languages. A certification isn't a college degree (though members are consistently encouraged to go to college), but a\r\ncertification can make the resume of a college graduate more appealing to employers. After Java and C#, there are a multitude of Web design languages and techniques that can be\r\nexplored and mastered, and the group is setting out to do just that. The programming group also doesn't want to limit itself to only those in Casey, which is part of the reason for the name change.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach a certain point in our learning, we would like to do free software projects for local organizations, with our preference being charitable and not-for-profit institutions.\r\n\r\nPlease watch the video at willyfarrell.com/coders. It’s only 9 minutes long and is a real eyeopener about the importance of what the Mid-American Programming Group is doing. What \r\nthe group is doing is good for our community; programmers often get jobs where they can work from home, so our best and brightest can stay right here in Casey. And what the group is doing is good for our young people – did you catch the part in the video where 1.4 million programming jobs will be created but only 400,000 U.S. students will get the required training for those jobs? Let’s give our young people the opportunity to get one of those jobs that will be \r\ncreated and drive the economy of the future.\r\n\r\nIt costs about $500 to add a member to the group – laptop, mouse, textbook, thumb drive. Up to now, Willy has borne those expenses, and happily. But Willy can only afford to add one member every month or two, say 8 or 9 per year. That pace is too slow for the group to have the kind of community impact for which it is striving. The teachers at the high school have identified upwards of a dozen students that would benefit by being in the group. They are also \r\nreaching out to high schools in nearby towns to identify students in those schools that would like to join the group. If they all came at once, Willy could not afford to equip each one of them.\r\n\r\nWith $10,000, 20 students could join the group. The group needs help raising those kinds of funds. Won’t you help the Mid-American Programming Group add members and give them the tools and equipment they need for success?\r\n\r\nMichael Leichty Contact Info:\r\nPhone: 217-932-2175\r\nEmail: mleichty@cw.k12.il.us\r\n\r\nWilly Farrell Contact Info: \r\nPhone: 219-218-0688\r\nEmail  wf@willyfarrell.com\r\nWeb: willyfarrell.com/coders", format: "Afterschool program", street: "306 E Edgar Ave", longitude: -87.9894, latitude: 39.3046, contact_email: "mleichty@cw.k12.il.us", phone: "217-932-2175", languages: "---\n- After java\n- Java\n- Plan to teach c#\n- Then javascript\n- Then on and on with the web languages/technolgoies\n- Then php\n", country: nil},

The National Program of Educational Informatics of the Ministry of Public Education and the Omar Dengo Foundation (PRONIE MEP-FOD), that currently serves 512.232 students in 1,668 public elementary and high schools thorough the country, is strongly linked to the epistemological theories of Piaget and Vigotsky concerning social and cognitive development in individuals, and has based its pedagogical foundation on the constructionist theory of Dr. Seymour Papert. The Foundation, based on a constructivist approach to teaching and learning, introduced the use of computers in public schools in Costa Rica in 1988 to provide opportunities for children and youth to improve their capacities and computer programming has always been at the core of the program´s activities. \r\n\r\nThe Foundation´s programs have introduced programming throughout Costa Rica´s public school system as a mean for children and youth to make representation and share personal interpretations of their knowledge and they have started programming computers from an early age. Teachers and researchers have been trained to facilitate computational thinking tasks and approaches proposed by researchers from MIT such as tinkering, debugging, remixing, abstraction, and use of modules.  Elementary school children start by using tile programming interfaces (drag and drop) as a way to simplify syntax structure and help them understand algorithmic thinking. High-school age youth expand their programming experience with the use of open code writing (scripting) and object-oriented programming.  Programming is then used as a powerful resource for developing abilities such as learning to reason logically and creatively, interactive resolution of problems, learning by design of robots, and teamwork.  This special know-how has been of central importance for the development of a digital culture among Costa Rican children, youth and teachers, and for the attainment of significant levels of technology fluency and overall improved capacities. \r\n", format: "Other", street: "Calle 25A Avenidas 10 y 10B", longitude: -84.0753, latitude: 9.92953, contact_email: "eduardo.monge@fod.ac.cr", phone: "50625276105", languages: "---\n- Alice\n- Etoys\n- HTML\n- Java\n- Javascript\n- Lego nxt-g\n- Logo\n- Microworlds\n- Scratch\n- Starlogo tng\n", country: nil},
